This is a Russian keyboard layout file for MacOS.
Use it if for some reason the built-in system keyboard layouts [stop working](https://youtu.be/EO3C9anb2TE).

To install:

    $ cp Russian-JCUKEN.icns Russian-JCUKEN.keylayout "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts"

Next, go to System Preferences/Keyboard/Input Sources.
Click on the plus icon, then go to Others and select Russian.
You may need to restart your applications for the change to take effect.
